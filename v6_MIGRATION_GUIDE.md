# Braintree Android Drop-In v6 Migration Guide

See the [CHANGELOG](/CHANGELOG.md) for a complete list of changes. This migration guide outlines the basics for updating your Braintree Drop-In integration from `v5` to `v6`.

`v6` of the Drop-In SDK is compatible with `v4` of the [Braintree Android SDK](https://github.com/braintree/braintree_android).

_Documentation for v6 will be published to https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs once it is available for general release._
